# Soleil Levant WebGL

## About the Project
This is a university project that aims to recreate Claude Monet's *Impression, Sunrise* painting using WebGL. The goal was to build this project with **a budget of 0â‚¬**, which means the representation is not 100% realistic but serves as an artistic and technical experiment.

## Download the 3D Models
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the 3D models are hosted on Google Drive. Please follow these steps to set up the project properly:

1. **Download the models** from the following link:
    [Google Drive - 3D Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J8ECrqgiFjcTI1G78nXEd2ZTxh3ZWGEs?usp=sharing)

2. **Extract the files** if they are compressed (e.g., `.zip`).

3. **Move the files** to the `models/` directory inside the project folder.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/soajulio/Soleil_Levant_WebGL.git
   cd Soleil_Levant_WebGL
   ```
2. Make sure you have a local server (like Python's built-in server) to serve WebGL:
   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by Claude Monet's *Impression, Sunrise*.
- Built using **WebGL**, **Three.js**, and **GLTF models**.

Enjoy the experience!
